**App Summary**
Many college students have limited access to transportation but still rely on cars for groceries and other errands. Stüber facilitates voluntary ridesharing between students and local residents who have vehicles and those who do not. If a car owner plans to go to the grocery store and is willing to offer seats, they can post a ride on Stüber for others to view and request to join. For security and trust, users have profiles which others may rate depending on experience. Primary users include both riders seeking transportation and drivers offering available seats.
